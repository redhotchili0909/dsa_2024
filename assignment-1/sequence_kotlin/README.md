# Assignment 1 - Hello Kotlin!

**1. What features do you like about Kotlin?**\
The ability to declare variable types seemed very useful to me in the long run.\
**2. Are there things you were expecting to find that you havenâ€™t?**\
I thought it was strange that dictionaries were called a map in Kotlin\
**3. What questions do you have?**\
I'm still getting used to the IDE. I would like to know how to properly install packages/modules.
# sequence_kotlin overview
## digitList

- Create a list of an integer's digits in order
- Given an integer, return a list of the integer's digits, from most significant to least significant. Thus the number 123 would result in the list [1, 2, 3]

## assemble
- Assemble a list of digits into an integer
-   Given a list of single-digit integers representing the digits of a possibly multi-digit integer, return the integer corresponding to those digits. As an example the list [1, 2, 3] would be assembled into the integer 123

## nextNumber
- Create an integer that is read-out from an integer
- For the output integer, the digits in the input integer is "read-aloud"

## lookAndSay

- Output a look_and_say sequence with the given length

# Reflection

It was very interesting to experience declaring variable types, but I felt the general purpose/syntax of the original code didn't feel much different. Therefore, I didn't experience much trouble in porting my Python code into Kotlin.
